	<description><![CDATA[AUTOMATIC's Original Trader ships mod, updated to 1.4 by BlackFox.

Adds trader spaceships to the game. Ships will visit your colony, preferring landing pads, and trade with you just like visiting caravans. Trader ships are meant to replace orbital traders, but you can set both to be active in settings.

1.4 update 1: Added several new options to customize the trader ships events.
